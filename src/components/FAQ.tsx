      question: "How do I know which category to join?",
      answer: "You should choose your category based on your current school level, not your age. For example, if you are in Secondary 2, even if you're 15 years old, you should join the Lower Secondary category."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I submit more than one video?",
      answer: "No. Each student may submit one entry only."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I use slides, props, pictures, or music in my video?",
      answer: "No – videos should be unedited and feature only your voice and presence. No slides, props, pictures, background music, or special effects are allowed as the speech is designed to be short and impactful, showcasing your natural speaking ability."
    },
    {
      question: "Can homeschoolers or international school students join?",
      answer: "Yes, all students based in Singapore are welcome, including those from homeschools and international schools."
    },
{
      question: "What should I wear in my video?",
      answer: "Students should dress in their school uniform. University and Polytechnic students can dress in smart casual attire."
